# Vire

**Vire** is a programming language: *as light as Python, as fast as C/Rust,
memory-safe — without lifetimes, without ownership syntax, without manual memory
management.* It compiles **AOT** to native binaries through a whole-program solver
and an LLVM backend, and runs (for the provable majority) **without a runtime**.

> Name from the Latin *vīrēs* ("forces, strength") — light, yet powerful.
> File extension `.vr`. Current state: language specified; front-end, solver and
> backend built, compiling `.vr` to native binaries and benchmarked against
> Rust/C++/gcc.

```vire
fn word_counts(text: Str) -> Map[Str, Int] {
    mut counts = {}
    for word in text.lower().split_whitespace() {
        counts[word] = counts.get(word).or(0) + 1
    }
    counts
}
```

Reads like Python — compiles to a memory-safe, RC-eliminated native binary.

## The idea in one paragraph

Classically, memory safety comes with one of three costs: a garbage collector
(runtime/pauses), ownership + lifetimes (Rust's annotation burden), or reference
counting (a small runtime). Vire resolves this **per program site**: a whole-program
solver **proves** ownership where possible (→ zero runtime, like Rust), and falls
back to lean RC where necessary. The programmer writes **zero** memory annotations.
Un-annotated types are **inferred** (Python ergonomics without Python's dynamic cost) —
today by a best-effort *monomorphic* unifier over a scalar type lattice (Int/Float/Bool/
ref/Unit); full Hindley–Milner with trait resolution and reference-type checking is
roadmap, not shipped (see [TODO.md](TODO.md) *Front-end completeness* and
[language/EVALUATION.md](language/EVALUATION.md) §5). This is feasible because Vire is
**closed-world** (all sources available at compile time) and sits on a backend that
already delivers exactly these proofs.

## Status & architecture

Vire is a **front-end** on a **built, measured backend**. The whole pipeline is
functional: `vire build foo.vr -o foo` and `vire run foo.vr` produce and execute
native binaries today.

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| **Vire front-end** (`crates/vire`) — lexer, parser, macro expansion, recursive inline, type inference, lowering to SSA IR | **built & working** — compiles `.vr` end-to-end to native code |
| **Mid-level IR** (`crates/ir`) | built |
| **Whole-program solver** (`crates/solver`) — devirtualization, inlining, escape/RC elision, bounds/null-check elision, field auto-narrowing, region inference | built |
| **LLVM backend** (`crates/backend`) — textual IR + clang `-O2 -flto -march=native`; TBAA, `!invariant.load`, branch weights, cold error paths; hosted/freestanding/threads | built |
| **Runtime** (`crates/driver`) — RC + Bacon–Rajan cycle collector, slab allocator, packed 16-byte header | built |
| **GPU kernels** (`@gpu`) — single-source device functions → NVPTX (`llc`) → PTX → CUDA Driver-API launch; up to **16× vs CPU** on an RTX 5070, bit-exact for integer kernels | built — [language/GPU-KERNELS.md](language/GPU-KERNELS.md), [benchmarks/gpu/](benchmarks/gpu/) |

The backend was developed and hardened via a **Java-bytecode front-end prototype**
(the `fastjavac` path), whose **65 heap-balance regression tests (0 live objects at
exit)** are the soundness oracle — the floor every optimization must keep green. See
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [benchmarks/](benchmarks/).

## Benchmarks (snapshot)

Cross-compiler on this machine (best-of-5, output-verified; Vire vs clang++ 22, g++
16, rustc 1.97, all `-O2 -flto -march=native`; measured 2026-07):

| Benchmark | Vire vs Rust | Vire vs clang++ | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| montecarlo / nbody / bitmanip | **~1.00×** | **~1.00×** | compute-bound, parity |
| **struct** (stack structs) | **0.90×** | **0.89×** | beats both |
| **binary-trees** | **0.91×** | 1.29× | region inference + move-on-last-use |
| **matmul** (256³ ikj) | **0.98×** | **0.91×** | ikj order → vectorized SAXPY; affine index elided |
| **vcall** (dyn dispatch) | **1.00×** | **0.44×** (2.3× faster) | solver devirtualization; beats clang `virtual` |
| **binsearch** (10M) | 1.03× | **0.78×** | midpoint check *proved* redundant + elided — safely |
| **sort** (quicksort 2M) | 1.06× | 1.33× | uncatchable checks abort noreturn (Rust's structure) |

Across the 12 Vire benchmarks (suite + [benchmarks/vire-lang/](benchmarks/vire-lang/)),
memory-safe Vire vs memory-safe Rust is a **geometric-mean 1.00× (median 1.00×) — at
Rust parity**, with every benchmark within ~9% of Rust and several faster (struct 0.90×,
binary-trees 0.91×, matmul 0.98×, vcall = Rust / 0.44× clang). On the **Java→native**
oracle path the same backend takes **NBody 35.7× → 1.16×** (`Math.sqrt` now lowers to the
`sqrtsd` intrinsic, not a 60-iteration Newton call) and **binary-trees 1.73× → 0.81×,
beating Rust** (a shape/freshness analysis drops the cycle collector for provably
tree-shaped types). The solver *proves* array indices in range (the `(lo+hi)/2` midpoint,
the affine `r*n+k`) and, where a check can't be elided, makes it as cheap as Rust's (a
noreturn abort when provably uncatchable) — **all fully memory-safe: a genuinely
out-of-bounds access still throws**.

**Memory (peak RSS)** is reported alongside time in every suite: Vire is **at or below
both Rust and C++ on essentially every benchmark** — ~2 MB under clang everywhere (no
`libstdc++`/iostream baseline), level with Rust, and even binary-trees (pure alloc/GC)
peaks *under* both (RC frees eagerly, 0 live, no growing GC heap).

Beyond single kernels, [benchmarks/complex/](benchmarks/complex/) runs **multi-algorithm
workloads** (a generate→sort→search→histogram pipeline; integer k-means) and **fair
fork/join multithreading** — parallel Monte-Carlo and Mandelbrot with **4 threads in
Vire, Rust, and C++** (bit-identical output). The threading is real: `pmontecarlo` scales
**3.98× on 4 cores** and Vire is at/ahead of Rust/C++ (0.97×) — `spawn`/`Atomic` add no
overhead over raw `std::thread`. See [TODO.md](TODO.md), [benchmarks/](benchmarks/).

## Building & compiling programs

The whole pipeline is one command. Optimization is on by default
(`clang -O2 -flto -march=native`, closed-world AOT for the host CPU).

```console
$ vire build hello.vr -o hello     # compile to a native binary
$ vire run hello.vr                # compile to a temp binary and run it
```

**Common flags** (all additive to the same solver + backend):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o FILE` | output path |
| `--emit=obj\|asm\|llvm\|ir\|staticlib` | stop at a `.o` (one relocatable C-ABI object, incl. `main`), assembly, LLVM/mid IR, or a `.a` |
| `--deps FILE` | write a Makefile/Ninja depfile (for incremental builds) |
| `-I DIR` | include path for `native "c"` blocks / headers |
| `--pkg NAME` | pull cflags+libs from **pkg-config** (first-class system deps) |
| `-l NAME` / `--obj FILE` | link a library / a `.c`/`.cpp`/`.o`/`.a` (C/C++/Rust via the C ABI) |
| `--target TRIPLE` | cross-compile (e.g. `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) |
| `--log-level debug\|info\|warn\|error\|off` | build-time log threshold (below it = zero instructions) |
| `--syntax FILE` | opt-in custom keyword spellings (also via an in-file `//!syntax: FILE`) |
| `-g` / `--backtrace` | DWARF debug info (`.vr:line`) / native backtrace on an uncaught throw |

FFI is source-level: `extern "C" header "h.h" { … }` auto-generates bindings from a C
header at compile time; `native "c"/"c++"/"asm" """ … """` blocks are compiled and linked
in automatically (and **proven memory-safe** by the vendored verifier, the sound
replacement for `unsafe`).

### With Meson

A whole `.vr` program lowers to **one relocatable C-ABI object** (the runtime `main`
included), so Meson links it like any C/C++/Rust object. Using only the stock Meson DSL
(no plugin to install):

```meson
project('app', 'c', meson_version: '>=1.1.0')
vire = find_program('vire')

main_obj = custom_target('main.vr.o',
  input: 'main.vr', output: 'main.vr.o',
  command: [vire, 'build', '@INPUT@', '--emit=obj', '-o', '@OUTPUT@', '--deps', '@DEPFILE@'],
  depfile: 'main.vr.o.d')                 # incremental: rebuilds on source/header change

executable('app', 'util.c', objects: main_obj, link_args: ['-lm'])
```

```console
$ meson setup builddir && ninja -C builddir && ./builddir/app
```

This links a Vire object with a C object (`-lm` because the runtime uses libm). Add
`-pthread` if the program uses `spawn`, and system libraries via `--pkg`. An optional
`import('vire')` module (`vire.executable()` / `vire.static_library()`) and a tested,
runnable example are in [build-integration/meson/](build-integration/meson/).

## Core language ideas (in brief)

- **Inference over annotation** — types appear nowhere yet are all known.
- **No `null`** — `Option[T]`; no exceptions — errors are values (Go spirit) with
  `?` propagation.
- **`type`** for product and sum types (value types, no object header), **traits** +
  monomorphized **generics**.
- **`comptime`** — code that runs in the compiler: reflection, derivations,
  conditional compilation — zero-cost, no runtime metadata ballast.
- **Invisible memory** — stack/heap/RC decided by the solver; `&` optional.
- **Concurrency safe by construction** — channels (CSP) + `Mutex`/`Atomic`; the
  solver rejects shared bare mutable state.
- **GPU kernels** — a `@gpu fn k(i: Int, …)` runs data-parallel on the GPU
  (single-source: NVPTX → PTX → CUDA Driver-API launch), with the thread index
  injected like a `parallel_for` worker `(i, …)`. Up to **16× vs CPU** on an
  RTX 5070, bit-exact for integer kernels. See
  [language/GPU-KERNELS.md](language/GPU-KERNELS.md).
- **C native** — `extern "C"`/header bindings; C++/Rust via the C ABI. Meson
  first-class.

The name and details are provisional and easy to change; the design is the core.
